# Language Translation NLP

This repository is dedicated to building and experimenting with Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques for language translation. It contains code, datasets, and models for translating text between different languages using modern NLP approaches.

## Features

- Text translation between multiple languages
- Preprocessing and cleaning of text data
- Training and inference code for sequence-to-sequence models
- Evaluation metrics for translation quality

## Technologies Used

- Python
- NLP libraries: NLTK, spaCy, Hugging Face Transformers
- Deep Learning: PyTorch / TensorFlow
- Jupyter Notebooks for experiments

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Deekshanaik2004/language-translation-NLP-.git
   cd language-translation-NLP-
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run sample translation:**
   - Check out the `notebooks/` directory for demo notebooks.
   - Run `python main.py` for command-line translation (if available).
